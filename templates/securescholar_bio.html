            <div class='Bios'>
                <p>We came up with Secure Scholar after we noticed that NetOp Student Vision was only effective at monitoring the screen. A fateful mistake that gave us an edge in the race to perfect screen monitoring.</p>
                <p>Our SecureScholar app compares the list of urls that the teacher has allowed the student to go on to the one that the student is on. This method is foolproof as the url tells everything about the website.</p>
                <div id='SecureScholar bio'>
                    <p>It all started in the classroom with our teacher Ms. Young. She had challenged us to think of something that hadn't been invented before. We had sat there all day until discussion led us away from SOS watches to technology. And then we struck gold. We realized the problem with NetOp Student Vision was that it only monitored the screen(s). And for teachers, that was a major flaw. Teachers were always everywhere and nowhere. They could only either teach their students, look for lesson material, or monitor the screen. As you can see, NetOp did have a major flaw. That was when we knew that we had to compare the url(s) of the student's tabs to a list of eligible and teacher-approved lists. We knew that urls told everything about the website. From where to go on the website, to how to display the webpage. That was how SecureScholar was created.</p>
